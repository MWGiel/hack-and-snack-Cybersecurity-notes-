# Meow & Fawn — Lab Summary (brief)

**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Environment:** Virtual lab (Kali → Meow & Fawn VMs)  
**Targets:** `<MEOW_HOST>`, `<FAWN_HOST>` (anonymized)

**Scope:** reconnaissance → initial access → privilege escalation → post‑exploit → remediation.

**Key findings:**
- Common initial vectors: exposed backups, weak/default credentials, and public web files.
- Privilege escalation: misconfigured permissions / sudo rules / SUID binaries.
- Impact: full lab compromise (user + root) confirmed in both boxes.

*Commands and artifacts recorded privately — do not run tests on non‑owned systems.*
