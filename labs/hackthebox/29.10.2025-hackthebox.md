### Enumeration Methodology
-The whole enumeration process is divided into three different levels:
-Infrastructure-based enumeration 	
-Host-based enumeration 	
-OS-based enumeration
### Cloud Resources
The use of cloud, such as AWS, GCP, Azure, and others, is now one of the essential components for many companies nowadays. 
After all, all companies want to be able to do their work from anywhere, so they need a central point for all management. This is why services from Amazon (AWS), Google (GCP), and Microsoft (Azure) are ideal for this purpose.

Even though cloud providers secure their infrastructure centrally, this does not mean that companies are free from vulnerabilities. The configurations made by the administrators may nevertheless make the company's cloud resources vulnerable. 
This often starts with the S3 buckets (AWS), blobs (Azure), cloud storage (GCP), which can be accessed without authentication if configured incorrectly.
