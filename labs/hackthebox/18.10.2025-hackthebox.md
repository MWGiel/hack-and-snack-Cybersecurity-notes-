# Methods for retrieving files from a target

Methods for retrieving files from a compromised target:

- **Using HTTP (wget/curl concept):** Run an HTTP server on the attacker's machine and then use an HTTP client on the remote host to download the file. 

- **Using SCP (concept):** Another method is to use SCP if SSH access to the remote host has been obtained. 

- **Using Base64 (concept):** In some cases we may not be able to transfer the file directly (for example, because of firewall protections). In this situation, a common technique is to encode the file into a text form (e.g., Base64), paste the encoded string on the remote host, and decode it there.
