# SMTP
- To interact with the SMTP server, we can use the telnet tool to initialize a TCP connection with the SMTP server.
The actual initialization of the session is done with the command mentioned above, HELO or EHLO.
---
### Footprinting the Service
- The default Nmap scripts include smtp-commands, which uses the EHLO command to list all possible commands that can be executed on the target SMTP server.
