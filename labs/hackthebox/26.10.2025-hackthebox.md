## Determine Firewalls and Their Rules

We already know that when a port is shown as filtered, it can have several reasons. In most cases, firewalls have certain rules set to handle specific connections. The packets can either be dropped, or rejected. The dropped packets are ignored, and no response is returned from the host.

This is different for rejected packets, which elicit an explicit response. TCP packets are returned with an RST flag, while ICMP can contain different types of error codes.

Such errors include:

   - Net Unreachable
   - Net Prohibited
   - Host Unreachable
   - Host Prohibited
   - Port Unreachable
   - Proto Unreachable
