# Hack The Box — Pentester Track: Next Steps & First Machine (note)  
**Date:** 19.10.2025
**Track:** Pentester (Hack The Box)  
**Context:** I completed the track's "first" machine during the path, but I had previous practice in labs before starting the track.

## Short summary
I progressed through the Hack The Box **Pentester** track and completed the (track) first machine. Although the platform calls it a first step, I already had prior lab experience (Kali, Metasploitable, HTB practice boxes), which made the initial machine straightforward. This note documents the learning plan going forward and a short reflection on that first box.

## Reflection on the "first" machine
- **What I did:** reconnaissance → service discovery → exploited a service → gained a shell → retrieved the flag.  
- **Experience note:** Having practiced on other vulnerable VMs beforehand significantly reduced time-to-first-compromise and made post-exploit tasks familiar.  
- **Lesson:** The "first" HTB machine is a good validation of fundamentals (scanning, basic exploitation, file handling), but prior hands-on practice speeds up progress and deepens understanding.
