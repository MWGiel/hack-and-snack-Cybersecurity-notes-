# Introduction to Nmap
- Network Mapper (Nmap) is an open-source network analysis and security auditing tool written in C, C++, Python, and Lua. It is designed to scan networks and identify which hosts are available on the network using raw packets, and services and applications, including the name and version, where possible. It can also identify the operating systems and versions of these hosts. Besides other features, Nmap also offers scanning capabilities that can determine if packet filters, firewalls, or intrusion detection systems (IDS) are configured as needed.

## Use Cases
- The tool is one of the most used tools by network administrators and IT security specialists. It is used to:
---
- Audit the security aspects of networks
- Simulate penetration tests
- Check firewall and IDS settings and configurations
- Types of possible connections
- Network mapping
- Response analysis
- Identify open ports
- Vulnerability assessment as well.
- Nmap Architecture
- Nmap offers many different types of scans that can be used to obtain various results about our targets. Basically, Nmap can be divided into the following scanning techniques:
---
### Host discovery
- Port scanning
- Service enumeration and detection
- OS detection
- Scriptable interaction with the target service (Nmap Scripting Engine)
- Syntax
- The syntax for Nmap is fairly simple and looks like this:

#### Introduction to Nmap
Mwegiel@htb[/htb]$ nmap <scan types> <options> <target>

##### NEXT STEPS
- finish the nmap module and hack simple machines
