## ðŸ§© Pre-Engagement

Pre-engagement involves educating the client and adjusting the contract.  
All tests, methods, and limitations are defined and contractually recorded.

### Typical Arrangements
- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**
- **Goals**
- **Scope**
- **Time Estimation**
- **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**

These points are discussed in meetings or calls before any testing begins.

---

##  Information Gathering

This phase focuses on **collecting data** about the target organization, software, and hardware.  
The goal is to find **potential security gaps** that can be leveraged later for exploitation.

---

##  Vulnerability Assessment

After gathering information, vulnerabilities are identified and analyzed.  
This step evaluates systems and applications manually or using automated scanners  
to find possible attack vectors and determine the overall **threat level**.

---

##  Exploitation

In this stage, identified vulnerabilities are **tested** using controlled attacks  
to gain **initial access** to the target systems.  
The purpose is to validate which weaknesses can be practically exploited.

---

##  Post-Exploitation

Once access is gained:
- Maintain access despite system changes.
- Attempt **privilege escalation** to obtain higher rights.
- Hunt for **sensitive data** (credentials, confidential files).
- Demonstrate **impact** to the client.

Post-exploitation can also serve as input for the **Lateral Movement** phase.

---

##  Lateral Movement

This phase describes **moving within the internal network** to access additional hosts.  
It often includes iterative post-exploitation activities.  

Example:
1. Gain access to a web server.
2. Escalate privileges and find credentials.
3. Use credentials to access a database server.
4. Extract sensitive data and repeat deeper into the network.

---

##  Proof-of-Concept (PoC)

Here, testers **document step-by-step** how they achieved access or compromise.  
The documentation helps clients understand:
- How vulnerabilities are chained together.
- What their real impact is.
- How to prioritize fixes.

Optionally, scripts or automation can be created to reproduce findings.

---

##  Post-Engagement

At this stage:
- **Detailed reports** are created for both technical and management audiences.
- **All traces of testing** are removed from systems.
- A **report walkthrough meeting** is held.
- Optionally, an **executive summary** is presented to the clientâ€™s leadership.
- Testing data is securely archived for a defined retention period.

##  Risk Management Process

![Risk Lifecycle](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/159041c2-04ea-45c7-bf2f-69a946eded88)

### 1. Identifying the Risk  
Recognize risks that the business faces (legal, environmental, market, regulatory, etc.).

### 2. Analyze the Risk  
Assess each risk for **impact** and **probability**, mapping them to business processes.

### 3. Evaluate the Risk  
Rank and prioritize risks.  
Decide to:
- **Accept** (unavoidable)
- **Avoid** (change plans)
- **Control** (mitigate)
- **Transfer** (insure)

### 4. Dealing with Risk  
Work directly with stakeholders to **eliminate or contain** risks.

### 5. Monitoring Risk  
Continuously observe for changes in impact or likelihood (e.g., from *low* â†’ *high*).
