# MDK3 — Beacon Flood (Fake Wi-Fi SSIDs) — Lab Note
**Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Environment:** Controlled lab (Kali Linux)

> **Legal / ethical notice:** All tests were conducted in a controlled lab environment on devices I own or have explicit permission to test. Do **not** run beacon floods or other disruptive wireless attacks on public or third-party networks — doing so is illegal and can disrupt services.

## What I did
Using **mdk3** I performed a **beacon flood** exercise that generated a large number of fake SSIDs on the wireless spectrum. The goal was to observe the effect on network discovery tools and client behavior in a safe lab setting.

---

## Observations
- A large quantity of fake SSIDs appeared during wireless scans, creating significant “noise” in the results.  
- Client devices showed long SSID lists; some users could be confused by similarly named networks.  
- Certain client behaviors were impacted (slower SSAN scanning, potential delays in selecting legitimate networks).  
- The test demonstrated how easy it is to pollute Wi-Fi discovery and make it harder to identify genuine APs.

## Impact / Risks
- Users may be misled into connecting to unknown networks (social-engineering risk).  
- In production environments, beacon flood can degrade the user experience and complicate troubleshooting.  
- Beacon flooding can be combined with phishing (fake captive portals) to increase the risk of credential theft.

---

## Defensive recommendations
- **User education:** train users to verify SSIDs and avoid connecting to untrusted networks.  
- **Wireless monitoring:** deploy Wi-Fi IDS/monitoring to detect sudden spikes in beacon frames and trigger alerts.
