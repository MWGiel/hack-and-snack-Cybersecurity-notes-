# Wi‑Fi tools — short notes

> **Legal / ethical note:** Use only in controlled labs or on networks where you have explicit permission.

- **mdk3 (authenticator flooding)** — floods deauth/auth frames → disconnects clients.  
- **mdk3 (beacon flood)** — creates many fake SSIDs → noise and user confusion.  
- **evilmaker** — tools for restricting/blocking devices on a network.  
- **fer-wifi-cracker** — attempts to recover router passwords (WPS/web/default creds).  
- **wifite** — automated handshake capture and dictionary-based password cracking.

**Quick defenses:** use strong passphrases, disable WPS, keep firmware updated, enable 802.11w (protected management frames), and monitor for unusual deauth/beacon activity.
