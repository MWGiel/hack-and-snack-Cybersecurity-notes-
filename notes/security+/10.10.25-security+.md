# Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)

## Authentication

**Authentication** is a security measure that ensures individuals or entities are who they claim to be during a communication or transaction.  

### 5 Commonly Used Authentication Methods

1. **Something you know** – e.g., passwords, PINs  
2. **Somewhere you are** – location-based verification  
3. **Something you do** – behavioral patterns, gestures  
4. **Something you have** – tokens, smart cards, devices  
5. **Something you are** – biometrics like fingerprints or retina scans  

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Combines two or more authentication methods to enhance security.  

**Importance of Authentication:**
- Prevent unauthorized access  
- Protect user data and privacy  
- Ensure resources are accessed by valid users only  

---

## Authorization

**Authorization** pertains to the permissions and privileges granted to users or entities **after they have been authenticated**.  
- Determines **what a user is allowed to do** in the system.

---

## Accounting

**Accounting** is a security measure that ensures **all user activities** during a communication or transaction are properly tracked and recorded.  
- Provides audit trails  
- Enables monitoring and compliance verification

## Security Control Categories

Security controls are mechanisms implemented to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems.  

There are **four broad categories of security controls**:

1. **Technical Controls** – Implemented through technology (e.g., firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection systems).  
2. **Managerial Controls** – Focus on policies, procedures, and risk management strategies.  
3. **Operational Controls** – Involve human actions such as training, incident response, and change management.  
4. **Physical Controls** – Protect physical assets and facilities (e.g., locks, CCTV, access cards).
