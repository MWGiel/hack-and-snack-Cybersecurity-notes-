# 🧠 Information Security Basics

## 🔒 Information Security
The act of protecting **data and information** from:
- Unauthorized access  
- Unlawful modification  
- Disruption or disclosure  
- Corruption and destruction  

---

## 💻 Information Systems Security
Protecting **systems** that hold and process critical data.

---

## 🧩 CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** — protecting data from unauthorized access.  
- **Integrity** — ensuring data remains accurate and trustworthy.  
- **Availability** — ensuring data and systems are accessible when needed.  

---

## 🧠 C.I.A.N.A Model
- **Confidentiality**  
- **Integrity**  
- **Availability**  
- **Non-repudiation** — proving that an action or event occurred and cannot be denied.  
- **Authentication** — verifying the identity of users or systems.  

---

## 🔑 Triple A of Security
- **Authentication** — verifying who someone is.  
- **Authorization** — determining what that person can do.  
- **Accounting (Auditing)** — tracking actions and resource usage.  

---

## 🧱 Zero Trust Model
> “Never trust, always verify.”

A security model based on the principle that **no one—inside or outside the organization—should be trusted by default**.

---

## ⚠️ Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Risks
- **Threat** — anything that could cause harm, loss, or compromise to IT systems.  
- **Vulnerability** — any weakness in system design or implementation.  
- **Risk Management** — minimizing the likelihood and impact of threats while ensuring desired outcomes.

---

## 🔐 Confidentiality
Protects information from unauthorized access and disclosure through:
- **Encryption** — converting data into code to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Access Controls** — ensuring only authorized users can access specific data.  
- **Data Masking** — obscuring sensitive data while keeping it usable for authorized users.  
- **Physical Security Measures** — protecting physical and digital assets (servers, workstations).  
- **Training and Awareness** — regular security awareness sessions for staff.  

---

## ⚙️ Integrity
Ensures the **accuracy and trustworthiness** of data throughout its lifecycle.

### Key Techniques:
- **Hashing** — converts data into a fixed-size value.  
- **Digital Signatures** — use encryption to verify integrity and authenticity.  
- **Checksums** — verify data integrity during transmission.  
- **Access Controls** — prevent unauthorized modifications.  
- **Regular Audits** — review logs and detect unauthorized changes.  

---

📘 **Summary:**  
Information security is built on the principles of **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**, enhanced with **Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability**.  
Strong controls, continuous training, and a Zero Trust mindset are essential to maintaining a secure environment.
