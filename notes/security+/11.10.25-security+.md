# Security Control Categories and Types

## Security Control Categories

Security controls are essential mechanisms implemented to **protect systems, data, and infrastructure** from various security threats.  
They can be grouped into **four broad categories**, each addressing different aspects of cybersecurity.

### 1. Technical Controls
- Technologies, hardware, and software mechanisms implemented to **manage and reduce risks**.  
- Examples: Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), encryption, antivirus software.

### 2. Managerial Controls
- Also referred to as **administrative controls**.  
- Involve **strategic planning and governance** aspects of security.  
- Examples: Security policies, risk assessments, security frameworks, compliance management.

### 3. Operational Controls
- **Procedures and measures** designed to protect data on a **day-to-day basis**.  
- Mainly governed by **internal processes and human actions**.  
- Examples: Security training, incident response, access management procedures.

### 4. Physical Controls
- **Tangible, real-world measures** implemented to protect physical assets.  
- Examples: Locks, CCTV cameras, security guards, biometric access systems.

## Security Control Types

Security controls can also be categorized based on their **purpose or function**.  
There are **six basic types** of security controls:

### 1. Preventive Controls
- **Proactive measures** implemented to **stop potential threats** or breaches before they occur.  
- Examples: Firewalls, security awareness training, access controls.

### 2. Deterrent Controls
- **Discourage potential attackers** by making attempts appear difficult or risky.  
- Examples: Warning banners, visible security cameras, legal disclaimers.

### 3. Detective Controls
- **Monitor and alert** organizations to malicious activities as they occur or shortly thereafter.  
- Examples: IDS/IPS systems, log monitoring, security audits.

### 4. Corrective Controls
- **Mitigate potential damage** and **restore systems** to their normal state after an incident.  
- Examples: Backup restoration, patch management, incident response actions.

### 5. Compensating Controls
- **Alternative measures** implemented when primary security controls are not feasible or effective.  
- Examples: Manual reviews, additional authentication layers, temporary technical solutions.

### 6. Directive Controls
- **Guide, inform, or mandate actions** through policies or documentation.  
- Set the **standards for acceptable behavior** within an organization.  
- Examples: Security policies, procedures, training manuals.

**Summary:**  
Security controls form a **layered defense strategy**, combining technical, managerial, operational, and physical measures.  
Their purpose is to **prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from** cybersecurity incidents effectively.
