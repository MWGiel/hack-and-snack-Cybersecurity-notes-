## Key DNS Concepts

In the Domain Name System (DNS), a zone is a distinct part of the domain namespace that a specific entity or administrator manages. Think of it as a virtual container for a set of domain names. For example, example.com and all its subdomains (like mail.example.com or blog.example.com) would typically belong to the same DNS zone.

The zone file, a text file residing on a DNS server, defines the resource records (discussed below) within this zone, providing crucial information for translating domain names into IP addresses.
