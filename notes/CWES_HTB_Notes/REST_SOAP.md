## SOAP
The SOAP (Simple Objects Access) standard shares data through XML, where the request is made in XML through an HTTP request, 
and the response is also returned in XML. Front end components are designed to parse this XML output properly.
### The REST
(Representational State Transfer) standard shares data through the URL path 'i.e. search/users/1', and usually returns the output in JSON format 'i.e. userid 1'.
