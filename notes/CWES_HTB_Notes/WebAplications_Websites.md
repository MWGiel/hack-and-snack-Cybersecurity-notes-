### Web Applications vs. Websites

In the past, we interacted with websites that are static and cannot be changed in real-time. This means that traditional websites were statically created to represent specific information, and this information would not change with our interaction. 
To change the website's content, the corresponding page has to be edited by the developers manually. 
These types of static pages do not contain functions and, therefore, do not produce real-time changes. That type of website is also known as Web 1.0.
Comparison of website and web app: Website has static pages, same for everyone; Web app has dynamic, interactive pages, different for each user.
On the other hand, most websites run web applications, or Web 2.0 presenting dynamic content based on user interaction. Another significant difference is that web applications are fully functional and can perform various functionalities for the end-user, while web sites lack this type of functionality.
