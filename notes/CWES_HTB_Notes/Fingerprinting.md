### Fingerprinting 
focuses on extracting technical details about the technologies powering a website or web application. Similar to how a fingerprint uniquely identifies a person, the digital signatures of web servers, operating systems, and software components can reveal critical information about a target's infrastructure and potential security weaknesses. This knowledge empowers attackers to tailor attacks and exploit vulnerabilities specific to the identified technologies.
## Wafw00f
Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are security solutions designed to protect web applications from various attacks. Before proceeding with further fingerprinting, it's crucial to determine if inlanefreight.com employs a WAF, as it could interfere with our probes or potentially block our requests.
