# Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open-source industry standard for assessing the severity of security vulnerabilities.
This scoring system is often used as a standard measurement for organizations and governments that need to produce accurate and consistent severity scores for their systems' vulnerabilities. 
This helps with the prioritization of resources and the response to a given threat.

## CVSS scores 
are based on a formula that uses several metrics: Base, Temporal, and Environmental. When calculating the severity of a vulnerability using CVSS,
the Base metrics produce a score ranging from 0 to 10, modified by applying Temporal and Environmental metrics. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) provides CVSS scores for almost all known, 
publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. At this time, the NVD only provides Base scores based upon a given vulnerability's inherent characteristics. The current scoring systems in place are CVSS v2 and CVSS v3. 
There are several differences between the v2 and v3 systems,
namely changes to the Base and Environmental groups to account for additional metrics. More information about the differences between the two scoring systems can be found here.
