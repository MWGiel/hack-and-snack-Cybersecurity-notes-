## Intro to Web Proxies
Web proxies are specialized tools that can be set up between a browser/mobile application and a back-end server to capture and view all the web requests being sent between both ends, essentially acting as man-in-the-middle (MITM) tools. While other Network Sniffing applications, like Wireshark, operate by analyzing all local traffic to see what is passing through a network, Web Proxies mainly work with web ports such as, but not limited to, HTTP/80 and HTTPS/443.

Web proxies are considered among the most essential tools for any web pentester. They significantly simplify the process of capturing and replaying web requests compared to earlier CLI-based tools. Once a web proxy is set up, we can see all HTTP requests made by an application and all of the responses sent by the back-end server. Furthermore, we can intercept a specific request to modify its data and see how the back-end server handles them, which is an essential part of any web penetration test.
