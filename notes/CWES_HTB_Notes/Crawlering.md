### Crawling

Crawling, often called spidering, is the automated process of systematically browsing the World Wide Web. Similar to how a spider navigates its web, a web crawler follows links from one page to another, collecting information. These crawlers are essentially bots that use pre-defined algorithms to discover and index web pages, making them accessible through search engines or for other purposes like data analysis and web reconnaissance.
## How Web Crawlers Work

The basic operation of a web crawler is straightforward yet powerful. It starts with a seed URL, which is the initial web page to crawl. The crawler fetches this page, parses its content, and extracts all its links. It then adds these links to a queue and crawls them, repeating the process iteratively. Depending on its scope and configuration, the crawler can explore an entire website or even a vast portion of the web.
