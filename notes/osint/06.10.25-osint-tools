## 🧠 Tools & Usage

### 🔍 theHarvester
Collects publicly available information (emails, hosts, subdomains) related to a domain.  
**Example:**
```bash
theharvester -d kali.org -l 600 -b google

Searches public sources (Google in this case) for information related to kali.org.
🌐 whois

Displays registration and ownership information about a domain — such as registrar, creation date, expiration date, and nameservers.
Example:

whois example.com

🕵️ Sherlock

Finds user profiles across multiple social platforms based on a username.
Use case:
Searched my own nickname and found linked social media accounts.

🧩 DMITRY (Deepmagic Information Gathering Tool)

Collects additional OSINT about domains, such as subdomains, email addresses, and open ports.
Example:

dmitry -winsepo www.onet.pl

🧅 Tor

A privacy-focused network and browser that hides your IP address and identity online.
Useful for anonymous browsing or protecting your digital footprint during OSINT research.

🧭 Observations

    OSINT tools can reveal a surprising amount of public data about domains and people.

    theHarvester + whois complement each other: one gathers public info, the other gives registration details.

    Sherlock helps identify personal exposure across platforms.

    Always cross-check data and respect privacy laws.

🛡️ Privacy & Defense Tips

    Regularly look up your own name and usernames with OSINT tools to see what’s public.

    Use strong privacy settings on social media.

    Hide domain registration data using WHOIS privacy features.

    Use Tor or a VPN when performing reconnaissance to protect your real IP.
